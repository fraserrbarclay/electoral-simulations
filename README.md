# Electoral Systems Simulation and Visualization Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to model and simulate the impact of the various electoral systems (such as *First-Past-The-Post*, *List Proportional Representation*, *Mixed-Member Proportional Representation*, *Single Transferable Vote*, and *Two-Round Systems*) across Europe.
Using data from seven European democracies, the project analyses how different voting systems can influence **voter representation**, **party representation**, and **governance stability**. The goal is to provide insights into the effects electoral system reforms could have on party dominance, and political stability.

## Countries Included
These countries have been chosen carefully, to represent a variety of electoral systems and political environments:
- *United Kingdom*: The birth place of **First-Past-The-Post (FPTP)**, one of the simplest electoral systems used since the Middle Ages.
- *Ireland*: A leading example of the **Single Transferable Vote (STV)** system, allowing voters to rank candidates by preference and ensuring proportional representation.
- *France*: A semi-presidential framework is in place where executive power is shared between the President and the Prime Minister. Both are elected through its **two-round system**.
- *The Netherlands*: Chosen for its **nationwide Proportional Representation (PR)** system with a very low electoral threshold, leading to complex coalitions. Voters vote for a party and their preference for individual candidates in that party.
- *Sweden*: A stable democracy with **regional PR**, where multi-party coalition governments are the norm, ensuring broad representation across the political spectrum. Voters vote for party only.
- *Germany*:  Home to the **Mixed-Member Proportional Representation (MMP)** system, which combines direct constituency seats with a nationwide proportional vote using the complex compensatory mechanisms to ensure proportionality, adjusting for overhang seats and maintaining overall proportional representation.
